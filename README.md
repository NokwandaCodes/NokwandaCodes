## Trying to install Linux...without the USB

<!--

I have decided to just post my journey here, for myself. In a way, I can also keep myself accountable. I have been aware that I am techTopicHopping, as I call it. This week I just have to learn git, the next I realise that maybe I need to brush up my SQL knowlege a little, and then suddenly, bash is the new black.

I need some structure, some accountability. So if I tell a reposatory on gitHub that I am doing shell scripting first, because I need to learn how to cut time when doing some stuff...then surely I will do bash scripting, before overtime season comes again. For real!

I am new to this. To all of everything do with with computers. I mean, sure I've used them for years, but I had no clue what that sticker with intel is, why do digital stores keep on emphasising what kind of CPU it has! I just wanted a working laptop. Trust me, it took me a while to figure out what git is, or even how to write a python script to print hello. But fun, learning has definely been fun. Well now I care, I guess, because I have been poking around, figuring out what's behind the apps (I believe I should be calling these GUIs?). And when I was learning shell scripting, it came to my attetion that maybe linux would be a better environment for me to learn more about what's behind the hood, because according to my noob brain, it will give me more control, I won't have to install a billion packages and software to do stuff? Hey, I am been told this by the billion resources on the internet, including ChatGPT.

And that's how I came to be asking the chatbot how I can install linux. The issue is, I didn't have a USB, just an SD card I never used.

ChatGPT gave me options.

1. Wubi
2. Grb2Wins
3. Ventoy
4. Borrow the USB nokwanda!

But I thought, why would I buy a whole new USB just this one thing. I didn't really want windows gone, I just wanted to see linux! I've heard so much about it. 

I started out with trying to boot from the SD card, it had 8GB memory, the ubuntu iso file is like 6GB. That didn't work out. But I did learn how to change the boot setting, like moving it from safe boot mode. Cool right. I tried a bunch of time, until I thought, now I want windows gone!

And then we tried (Me and Chat GBT) to create a virtual disk. Well I did it, I could see space, right that that I allocated, everything looked okay, Iwas so proud but it didn't boot. I tried this a billion times. But I leant how to create a virtual hardrive (I don't remember what's its called). That's something.

Then I tried Wubi. But I think at some point I started to install linux mint, not ubuntu using Wubi (please don't laugh at me) That means that I waiting minutes, looking at wubi install ubuntu again. And I was like, the heck. I checked the 5th try and I wanted to hit something. And then I had too many .iso files in my laptop. and I really wanted linux.

Then we tried Grub2Win. I have no idea what I was doing here, butthis one came close. It just kept fake booting, and just giving me errors. I think the iso file was in the wrong directory? At some point I had to give Grub2Win a custom code of where the iso file was, and change quotatoions somewhere. What the heck was I doing?

Anyway I gave up here and ordered a USB.

The USB will get here next week, because I didn't check the date. So yeah, I failed.

As I am finishing this, I am wondering, how can I change the settings, to simulate vim when I am writing here. because I can use the practise.....
